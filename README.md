##### _Simple 2 column web-page layout using HTML and CSS, September, 18 2015_

#### By **_Max Muller_**

## Description

I created this brief website for the second code review of my Intro to Programming Class at Epicodus. It demonstrates a simple 2 column web-page layout using HTML and CSS.

## Setup

* Visit [http://maxjmuller.github.io/layout-test](http://maxjmuller.github.io/about-max-muller) to view the page.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* I used nested divs with "overflow: hidden;" property to create equal length columns.
* I used the "box-sizing: border-box;" property to prevent relatively-sized columns with padding from stacking on top of each other.
